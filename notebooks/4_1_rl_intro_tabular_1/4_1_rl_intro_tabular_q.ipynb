        "In this tutorial, we will be learning about Reinforcement Learning, a type of Machine Learning where an **agent** learns to choose **actions** in an **environment** that lead to maximal **reward** in the long run. RL has seen tremendous success on a wide range of challenging problems such as learning to play complex games like [Atari](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/agent57-outperforming-the-human-atari-benchmark), [StarCraft II](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-the-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii) and [Dota II](https://openai.com/five/) and [Go](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961).\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike fields like supervised learning, where we give examples of expected behaviour to our models, RL focuses on *goal-orientated* learning from interactions, through trial-and-error. RL algorithms learn what to do (i.e., which actions to take) in an environment to maximise some reward signal. In settings like a video game, the reward signal could be the score of the game, i.e., RL algorithms will try to maximise the score in the game by choosing the best actions.  \n",

        "More precisely, in RL we have an **agent** which perceives an **observation** $o_t$ of the current state $s_t$ of the **environment** and must choose an **action** $a_t$ to take. The environment then transitions to a new state $s_{t+1}$ in response to the agent's action and also gives the agent a scalar reward $r_t$ to indicate how good or bad the chosen action was given the environment's state. The goal in RL is for the agent to maximise the amount of reward it receives from the environment over time. The subscript $t$ is used to indicate the timestep number. In this tutorial we will only consider fully observable games, which means thet state of the environment and observation of the agent are the same.\n",

The action ... can take values $\\{0, 1\\}$ indicating the direction of the fixed force the cart is pushed with. The observation ... includes the values corresponding to the following positions and velocities: Cart Position, Cart Velocity, Pole Angle, Pole Angular Velocity. Since the goal is to keep the pole upright for as long as possible, a reward of $+1$ for every step taken, including the termination step, is allotted.

        "In **value-based** reinforcement learning methods, agents maintain a **value** for all **state-action** pairs. A **value** of a **state-action** pair is telling us what reward to expect if we start at this **state**, take this action and afterwards follow a policy. Then, we use these **value** estimates to choose actions that maximise the value.\n",

        "\n",
        "Given a Q-function, it is easy to construct a good policy. For example, a greedy policy selects the action that maximises the Q-function estimate:\n",

Then, to learn the Q-function we can use [temporal difference (TD) learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_difference_learning).\n",
        "If we are given a sample of state $s$, action $a$, reward $r(s,a)$ and next state $s'$, we compute the TD-error $\\delta$ of a policy $\\pi_e$ as:\n",

One of the reasons for it is that the greedy policy with respect to a given estimate of $Q^\\pi$ fails to *explore* the environment as needed. The problem is that our initialisation of the Q-function was \"pessimistic\" that means that once any of the actions is tried and is successful (by chance), the agent will keep selecting this action as it is \"greedily\" exploiting the Q-function estimate."
