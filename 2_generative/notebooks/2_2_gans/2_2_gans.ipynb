        "The idea is for each Practical to be very clear. The first one especially, so some things to include should be:\n",
        "- What is it about?\n",
        " - A concise description of the task, enough context about how it relates to the tutorial topic, and an explanation of why is it important for the student to complete this exercise (in the context of outcomes). Having a clear goal and limiting the scope should help the students stay motivated.\n",
        " - We should ask a few questions that require the students to have a certain level of experience/intuition in order to answer, which they will acquire after completing the practical. It is good for them to have these questions in mind so they understand the point of the exercise. (Example: How does the learning rate affect the generated image quality?)\n",
        "- Relevant background.\n",
        " - The introduction should contain enough theoretical context for the task. For example - if the student needs to implement a convolution operation, reparameterisation trick or message passing in graphs, the high-level idea behind this should be explained with necessary schematics and equations that need to be transferred to code.\n",
        "- What is expected from the student to implement?\n",
        " - In the Practical 1. (basic) it is fine to leave for the student to implement very simple functions, or fill in lines which are crucial for the algorithm that are easy to figure out from the Task Description and the Theoretical Background. \n",
        " - We should aim to *over-comment* the code, and even explicitly try to link equations with lines of code.\n",
        " - If some jax-specific or other libraries have to be called, it is fine to say which one it is in the comment. We __don't__ want the students to spend time searching for methods, but they __should__ figure out how to use them properly by checking the docs etc. (Example given below, but could include NN layers etc)\n",
        " - The training and eval loop, and basic processing and visualisation functions should be already provided in the tutorial.\n",
        " - It is good to mention what the students will need to implement at the beginning of the practical, to manage expectations.\n"
