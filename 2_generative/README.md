## Practical 1: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

### Outline

In this tutorial you will learn how to implement Variational AutoEncoders. We will focus on several approaches to modelling the posterior distribution function, as well as approaches to optimisation that are used to train the models.

## Practical 2: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

In this tutorial you will learn how to implement Generative Adversarial Networks, their Generator and Discriminator functions and the Loss functions. You will run the full training loop, visualise and analyse the results and training statistics.
