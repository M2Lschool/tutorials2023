Based on the understanding behind these components, we designed two GNN models from scratch: Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and a modification that utilizes Graph Attention (GAT). In this tutorial, we see how these components make up the general Graph Network (GN) model in jraph. Furthermore, we will demonstrate how to solve different graph-related tasks using GNs on two more real-world datasets."

    "The final problem type we will explore is **link prediction**, an instance of an **edge-level** task. Given a graph, our goal is to predict whether a certain edge $(u,v)$ should be present or not. This is often useful in the recommender system settings (e.g., propose new friends in a social network, propose a movie to a user).\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, the first step is to obtain node latents $h_i$ using a GNN. In this context we will use the autoencoder language and call this GNN **encoder**. Then, we learn a binary classifier $f: (h_i, h_j) \\to z_{i,j}$ (**decoder**), predicting if an edge $(i,j)$ should exist or not. While we could use a more elaborate decoder (e.g., an MLP), a common approach we will also use here is to focus on obtaining good node embeddings, and for the decoder simply use the similarity between node latents, i.e. $z_{i,j} = h_i^T h_j$. Note that when defining the decoder, we need to consider whether the graph have undirected or directed graph; in the first case the function $f$ must be invariant w.r.t. the order of the nodes in each edge, i.e., $f(h_i, h_j) = z_{i,j} = z_{j,i} = f(h_j, h_i)$, while in the second case $f$ can also be variant.\n",
