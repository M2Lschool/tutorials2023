## Practical 1: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)

### Outline

In this tutorial you will learn about the various components of Graph Neural Networks and how to implement a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). We will train and test the GCN on a toy Karate dataset demonstrating how to train and evaluate GNNs on a node classification task.

## Practical 2: Graph Attention Networks (GAT)

In this tutorial you will implement Graph attention (GAT). Consequently, you will run the full training loop of GCN and GAT on the real-world citation graph OGBN-Arxiv for node classification and analyze the results.
