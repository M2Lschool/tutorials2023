    "Natural Language Processing Tutorial\n",
    "======\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the tutorial of the 2023 [Mediterranean Machine Learning Summer School](https://www.m2lschool.org/) on Natural Language Processing!\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will explore the fundamental aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Whether you are new to NLP or just beginning your journey, there's no need to worry, as the tutorial assumes minimal prior knowledge. Our focus will be on implementing everything from scratch to ensure clarity and understanding. To facilitate this, we will be using [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a library that offers an API similar to Numpy (and often identical) with the added benefit of automatic differentiation.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "We will keep our promise that (almost &#x1F60B; ) everything will be built from scratch. Indeed, all the vital and challenging components will be developed from zero. In fact the whole tutorial could be done only based on JAX. However, we recognize that certain minor technical details can become distracting if much time spent for them. For these tiny bits, we will ask help from [haiku](https://dm-haiku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to code neural network architectures, [optax](https://optax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to bring us the optimal parameters and [tokenizers](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/index) to quickly learning the vocabulary in each dataset. And the ubiquitous [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for tensor handling. That's all!\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be also nice, if you have access to GPU! And hopefully due to google colab you can immediately access a cudas-enabled environment pressing the the button below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Credits\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is created by [Vasilis Gkolemis](https://givasile.github.io/) and [Matko Bošnjak](https://matko.info). It is highly inspired by [Deep Learning with Python (DLP)](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python) the famous book of Francois Chollet, last year's [M2Lschool](https://github.com/M2Lschool/tutorials2022) NLP tutorial especially for the transformers part, the [annotated transformer](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/) presentation\n",

    "## Practical 2: Introduction to the Transformers architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Practical 2, where we will delve into the world of the Transformers architecture. Transformers were introduced in 2017 through the seminal work of Vaswani et. al, titled [\"Attention is All You Need\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). Since their inception, Transformers have garnered immense recognition, dominating the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and serving as a wellspring of inspiration across various domains of Machine Learning, including computer vision and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Practical will focus on the Transformers' encoder component (Transformers consist of two parts: the encoder and the decoder). In the end, we will use the Transformers' encoder to tackle the IMDB sentiment analysis task, which was introduced in Practical 1. The key aim of this session is to attain a comprehensive understanding of the core elements that constitute Transformers, with a significant emphasis on the foundational building-block: the self-attention layer. For this reason, we will code every from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Practical 3, we will also code the decoder part (they share common building blocks) and use the complete Transformers architecture to solve natural language generation tasks; these are the tasks where the transformers really shine! In particular, we will attempt to train a English-Greek translation machine!\n"

    "# 2 Introduction to the Transformers architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The content covered in this section is a summary of the material presented in last year's [M2Lschool](https://github.com/M2Lschool/tutorials2022). For those seeking a deeper dive into Transformers, the original source provides further in-depth information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 The Transformers Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers consist of two parts; the encoder and the decoder. The **encoder** is responsible for transforming raw input data, such as a sequence of words, into meaningful hidden representations and the **decoder** is used for predicting sequences of outputs, such as sequence of words. Therefore, the complete Transformer architecture (encoder and decoder) is appropriate for solving sequence-to-sequence tasks. For simpler classification tasks, such as the one that we will use in this Practical, we can only use the encoder part of the architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's briefly introduce the encoder and decoder, along with their core logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoder's role is to convert a sequence of words into dense, meaningful hidden representations, making them usable by other components like the decoder or other networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer Encoder (depicted in the left figure below) takes a source sequence, processes it using **Attention**, and passes the results through a **fully-connected feed-forward** block with pointwise non-linear activation. Residual connections and layer normalization are applied to both operations. This process is repeated $N$ times using stacked replicas to compute the final word representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoder's task is to learn the alignment between the source and target sequences. For instance, in machine translation, the decoder learns which words to generate in the target language based on the words in the source language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer Decoder (shown in the right figure below) can receive word representations as inputs and is given the **target sentence** during training to establish an association with the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, the decoder incorporates two attention operations: the first involves masked self-attention, and the second attends to the encoder output. We will delve into more details on these operations later in the tutorial.\n",

    "#### [ 📝 ] Multi-Headed Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "In the scaled dot product attention, an element of the sequence can attend to any other element, but it cannot focus on multiple aspects of the sequence simultaneously. To address this limitation, we introduce the concept of multi-headed attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the encoder unit of the Transformer, the first layer applies a *multi-headed self-attention*, which means that words within the sequence interact and align with each other (self-attention), and multiple different alignments are learned simultaneously (multi-headed) through separate *attention heads*. This learning paradigm, combined with a linguistically founded training objective, has contributed to the success of modern language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "With multi-headed attention, we have $h$ attention heads, where each attention head is a linear projection of the sequence $Q$, $K$, and $V$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{concat}(head_1, ..., head_h)W^O\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{head}_i = \\text{attention}(QW^Q_i, KW^K_i, VW^V_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $W^Q_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_q \\times d_k/h}$, $W^K_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_k \\times d_k/h}$, $W^V_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_v \\times d_v/h}$, and $W^O \\in \\mathbb{R}^{hd_v \\times d_v}$. It's important to note that $d_k$ and $d_v$ have the same dimension, so $d_v/h$ is equal to $d_k/h$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing multi-headed attention, we first apply linear projections for $Q$, $K$, and $V$ using matrix multiplication, and then split the results into $h$ heads. Next, we apply the scaled dot product attention independently for each attention head and concatenate the results.\n",
    "To facilitate your implementation, we provide a Haiku Module for Multi-Headed Attention. Take your time to review the class and understand its main components."

    "#### Positional Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer model does not use recurrent or convolutional layers in the encoder/decoder of the model (only attention mechanisms). However, this also has a drawback: since the model has no memory (no recurrent/convolutional layers), it can not take into account the *order* of the sequence elements. The position of words in the sequence is thus not encoded explicitly by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a solution to this issue, the original Transformer model uses a *positional encoding* scheme to represent the position of each element in the sequence. The positional encoding is added to the token embeddings of each element. Following the original paper, positional encodings are generated with multiple sinusoidal functions with varying frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positional encoding is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{PE}(pos, 2i) = \\sin \\left( \\frac{pos}{1000^{2i/d_{\\text{model}}}} \\right)$$\n",
    "$$\\text{PE}(pos, 2i+1) = \\cos \\left( \\frac{pos}{1000^{2i/d_{\\text{model}}}} \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $pos$ is the position of the element in the sequence, $d_{\\text{model}}$ is the model's embedding dimension, and $i$ is the index of the position vector. Note that this is not a learned parameter; the values are pre-computed and added to the token embeddings at the beginning of the forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, we can optionally apply dropout to the positional encodings during training, thus providing additional regularization for the model.\n",
