# [[M2L2023](https://www.m2lschool.org/home)] Tutorial 6: Diffusion Models

**Authors:** **[Alexander Cowen-Rivers](TODO)**, **[Despoina Christou](TODO)**

--- 

In this tutorial, we will have a *single* running colab covering three practicals. Please start with the beginner section of each practical, and then move on to the intermediate section.

## Practical 1: Forward Diffusion Process - Introducing Noise Schedulers

### Outline

In this practical, you will implement the forward diffusion process where you will design noise schedulers to corrupt the original image to map the image to the noise space, in a tractable manner.

---

## Practical 2: Backward Diffusion Process - Defining a model architecture

### Outline

In this practical, you will implement the backward diffusion process where you will design a neural network architecture that will map the noise back to the original image.

---

## Practical 3: Inference

### Outline

In this practical, you will implement algorithms to generate images using a trained diffusion model.
