        "In order to learn, we need a loss function or *objective*. In RL, the general objective is to maximise the expected episode return by taking actions in the environment. Suppose that the agent's policy is parametrised by a function with paramethers $\\theta$: then the actions are determined by $\\pi_\\theta(a|s)$. A very general way to represent a policy is with a neural network with parameters $\\theta$. So, the task of RL is to find the neural network parameters $\\theta$ that maximise\n",

        "Our policy neural network policy will take the observation as input and passes it through an MLP with `len(num_hiddens)` hidden layers and then outputs one scalar value for each of the possible actions (`2` in CartPole). The outputs of our policy network are [logits](https://qr.ae/pv4YTe). We will use Jax and Haiku for the neural network training. Please have a look [here](https://dm-haiku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) to understand Haiku transformations. Use [Haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku) (a library for implementing neural networks is JAX) to fill in the gaps in the policy `network` function. Hint: use functions `hk.Flatten` and `hk.nets.MLP`. Having done this, you can run the next cell \"Network test\" to check your implementation. You may need to comment out incomplete functions when running the tests.\n",

        "Next we implement `actor_step` function, which takes network parameters, timestep and random key and returns an action of the policy. Fill in the gaps in the `actor_step` function. Use [`jax.random.categorical`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.random.categorical.html) function to sample an action given the logits. Having done this, you can run the cell after \"Actor test\" to check your implementation.\n",
